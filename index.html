<h1 id="Hello-World-(Updated-September-2018)">Hello World (Updated September 2018)</h1><h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Writing technical blogs is one of my new year resolutions in 2018. The goal is to share my experience related to data science. During taking data science projects/assignment, I have benefitted a lot from techniqcal blogs written by people from different backgrounds online. I would be more than happy if I can help others in return for anything.</p>
<p>In addition, the blogs record my progress made so far. I know it might not be fancy and cutting-edge, but it is part of me. I believe in the work done step by step. I hope this website can last forever!</p>
<h2 id="A-little-bit-about-me">A little bit about me</h2><p>My dream is to be a data scientist in the near future. Driving insights from data is just cool. Beyong the data science, I have passion in exploring new things. You can know more from <a href="https://zigzagjie.github.io/aboutme/">about me</a></p>
<h2 id="Topics-Now-and-More">Topics Now and More</h2><p>For now, most of the blogs covered data manipulation and data visualization applied in Python with Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib packages. You can take a look by checking <a href="https://zigzagjie.github.io/projects/">projects</a> in the navigation bar or here. As I am studying machine learning, topics will extend to modeling very soon. Hopefully, the blogs are not limited to programming and analytic skills. Let's see what will happen in the future!</p>
