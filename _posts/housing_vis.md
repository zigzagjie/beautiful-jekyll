# Data Visualization

In last post, I shared some codes how to clean data in Melbourne Housing Dataset. This part we will continue doing data exploration on Melbourne Housing dataset, especially within data visualization tools.

First, let's import packages, load dataset and complete data cleaning as we did last time.


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as ny
import seaborn as sns

#load dataset
housing = pd.read_csv('housing.csv')
#filter rows whose buildingarea is zero
housing = housing[housing['BuildingArea']!=0]
#drop three columns
housing = housing.drop(['Address','SellerG','Bedroom2'],axis = 1) 
#get age of property
housing['Age'] = 2018-housing['YearBuilt']
#filter one 420-year-old property 
housing = housing[housing['Age']<500]
#extract Year, Month, Day from Date. First, you have to change string into datetime object
housing['Date']=pd.to_datetime(housing['Date'],infer_datetime_format=True)  ## transform Date column to datetime object
housing['Year']=pd.DatetimeIndex(housing['Date']).year
housing['Month']=pd.DatetimeIndex(housing['Date']).month
housing['Weekday']=pd.DatetimeIndex(housing['Date']).weekday
#finally, drop all NAN
housing=housing.dropna()
#Take a look!
housing.head()

```

Let us rescale price column in to Price(k)


```python
housing['Price(K)'] = housing['Price']/1000
housing.drop('Price',axis = 1,inplace=True) 
```

** Dataset is ready for visualize. **

### Show, don't tell!

## Viz 1

This plot will show the distribution of Price(K)


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
ax1=housing['Price(K)'].hist(bins=31)
ax1.set_xlabel('Price(K)')
ax1.set_xlim([0,8000])
```




    (0, 8000)




![png](output_6_1.png)


It seems like price is right-skew distributed. Most of properties has price ranging from 500-1500(k) AUD. 

## Viz 2

Price(K) VS Age of Property


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
ax2=housing.groupby('Age')['Price(K)'].mean().plot()
ax2.set_ylabel('Price(K)')
```




    Text(0,0.5,'Price(K)')




![png](output_9_1.png)


It is kind of time series data. The price shivers within age. Also, the price shivers greater as age increases. It might indicate for properties of older age, other features have greater impact on its price. However, we can still infer that the older the property is, the more expensive is if the age is lower than 125. The property older thatn 130 seems to be as expensive as the ones 50 years old.

## Viz 3

Price(K) VS Year, Month, and Weekday


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
g1=sns.factorplot(y='Price(K)',x='Year',kind='bar',size=4, aspect =3,data=housing)
g1.ax.set_title('Price(K) VS Year')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(K) VS Year')




    <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x25caf84a320>



![png](output_12_2.png)


Price from 2016-2018 did not have big changes. However, it should be noticed that scale is in 1000. 


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
g2=sns.factorplot(y='Price(K)',x='Month',kind='bar',size=4, aspect =3,data=housing)
g2.ax.set_title('Price(K) VS Month')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(K) VS Month')




    <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x25cb1ec97f0>



![png](output_14_2.png)


Properties sold on January and July had relatively lower price.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
g3=sns.factorplot(y='Price(K)',x='Weekday',kind='bar',size=4, aspect =3,data=housing)
g3.ax.set_title('Price(K) VS Week of Day')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(K) VS Week of Day')




    <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x25cb23064e0>



![png](output_16_2.png)


Properties sold on Wednesday had the lowest price. Should we buy a house on Wednesday then?


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(16,6))
g4=sns.factorplot(y='Price(K)',x='Month',kind='bar',hue='Weekday',size=5, aspect =3,data=housing)
g4.ax.set_title('Price(K) VS Month')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(K) VS Month')




    <matplotlib.figure.Figure at 0x25cb22e8dd8>



![png](output_18_2.png)


When combining weekday with month, we can have a closer look at price difference in differnet days. It seems that Wednesday in November and Thursday in March would be a better choice. This plot can also tell us during first two months, properties were sold only on Friday. Why?? Properties were only sold on Wednesday in March and November.  

## Viz 4

Price(K) VS Distance


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.regplot(x='Distance',y='Price(K)',data=housing,scatter_kws={'alpha':0.1},fit_reg=False)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x25caf9db4e0>




![png](output_21_1.png)


From this plot, we can two main insights:

- Most of properties have distance from 2ish to 15ish unit(miles/kms)
- The further the property is from the CBD, the less value the property has

This justifies the comman sense of the expensive properties in Melbourne CBD. Actually this rule applies to any big city!

## Viz 5

Price(K) VS Number of Rooms


```python
g5=sns.factorplot(y='Price(K)',x='Rooms',kind='bar',size=5, aspect =3,data=housing)
g5.ax.set_title('Price(K) VS Number of Rooms')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(K) VS Number of Rooms')




![png](output_24_1.png)


Actually, we can guess that the more room one property has, the bigger the property is. The bigger the property is, the more value it has. The guess is justified with those of 6 rooms. After it exceed 6 rooms, the rule is not applicable. SO.....Let's Viz6

## Viz6

Price(K) VS Buildingarea


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
ax3=sns.regplot(x='BuildingArea',y='Price(K)',data=housing,scatter_kws={'alpha':0.1},fit_reg=False)
ax3.set_title('Price(k) VS BuildingArea')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(k) VS BuildingArea')




![png](output_26_1.png)


Let's take a closer look at x:(0,1000) part. In other words, ignore extreme values (They could be outliers).


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
ax4=sns.regplot(x='BuildingArea',y='Price(K)',data=housing,scatter_kws={'alpha':0.3},fit_reg=False)
ax4.set_xlim((0,1100))
ax4.set_title('Price(K) VS BuildingArea(0-1100)')
```




    Text(0.5,1,'Price(K) VS BuildingArea(0-1100)')




![png](output_28_1.png)


For buildingarea ranging from 0 and 400, it seems to be a positive linear trend. It is not clear due to too many overlapping points.

## Viz 7

Price VS Region Name


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
housing.groupby('Regionname')['Price(K)'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x25cb1b25080>




![png](output_31_1.png)


Southern Metropolitan and Eastern Metropolitan are two regions which had the highest average housing price. You must be very curious about what these two regions. Let's take a look at Google Map!

The remaining content will be posted on my personal website. Please take a look!
