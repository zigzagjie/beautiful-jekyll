    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing technical blogs is one of my new year resolutions in 2018. The goal is to share my experience related to data science. During taking data science projects/assignment, I have benefitted a lot from techniqcal blogs written by people from different backgrounds online. I would be more than happy if I can help others in return for anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the blogs record my progress made so far. I know it might not be fancy and cutting-edge, but it is part of me. I believe in the work done step by step. I hope this website can last forever! \n",
    "\n",
    "## A little bit about me\n",
    "\n",
    "My dream is to be a data scientist in the near future. Driving insights from data is just cool. Beyong the data science, I have passion in exploring new things. You can know more from [about me](https://zigzagjie.github.io/aboutme/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics Now and More\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, most of the blogs covered data manipulation and data visualization applied in Python with Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib packages. You can take a look by checking [projects](https://zigzagjie.github.io/projects/) in the navigation bar or here. As I am studying machine learning, topics will extend to modeling very soon. Hopefully, the blogs are not limited to programming and analytic skills. Let's see what will happen in the future!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contact\n",
    "\n",
    "Any comments or questions about this website can be reached me directly by messaging me in LinkedIn or email to [me](jie.lou.cmu@gmail.com). Let's get connected!\n",
