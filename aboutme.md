## Who am I?

I am Jie Lou, a graudate student studying information systems Management(Global MISM) at Carnegie Mellon University. I studied Statistics and Mathematics at University of Missouri, COlumbia from 2015 to 2017. I was exchanged here when I studied in East China Normal University. 

I love Data Science, but I know it is not easy. With my solid background in statistical science, I am equipping myself with modern data science knowledge, including machine learning, deep learning and computer vision. Now, I am doing an internship in Adelaide, Australia to apply computer vision to improve property management.

This website was created on Feb. 13th, 2018. It is not too late. I am really new to html and markdown file to edit web pages. However, I believe I will add more content in the coming future.
