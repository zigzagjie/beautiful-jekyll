With my favourite animal social network poster to attend undergraduate research symposium. 

## Who am I?

I am Jie Lou, a second-year graudate student studying information systems Management at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I got dual bachelor degree in Statistics and Mathematics from University of Missouri as well as degree in Statistics from Normal China University.

I love Data Science, and expect to be a data scientist after graduation. With my solid background in statistical science, I am equipping myself with modern data science knowledge and skills.

 

## My experience with Data
### Animal Social Network

When I studied at MIZZOU, I completed a one-year research project about animal social network of dolphins and whales supervised by Dr. Schliep. I read several papers on animal association tests and competition tests with various statistical methods. Then, I wrote functions in R to realize the test. The most important technique is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) we applied to simulate the interactions between species. Finally, I wrote a report and made a presentation to the department.With the visualization and statistical analyses conducted in R, for the first time, I tasted the joy of analyzing big datasets and drive meaning insights. With great curiosity, I started thinking about applying data analytics to humans and business world.

### User Segmentation at Autodesk

During the summer in 2018, I worked at Autodesk as an intern data scientist. I was responsible for two data projects involving the entire data pipeline from data cleaning, data exploration, visualization, modeling and presentation. My analysis in user configuration with informative graphs and k means clustering results provided a big picture of customer segmentation for the AutoCAD feature development team. In the process of analyzing, I also applied association rules and visualized the connections between drawing primitives with NetworkX in Python. I believe data science is not just about cutting-edge techniques, it is more about communicate the story behind numbers. The job to uncover the mystery of patterns is charming and inspiring for me. Therefore, how can I miss the opportunity to work with awesome data scientists at Yelp? Yelp users are interacting with local business all the time in the form of leaving reviews. Understanding customer behavior is essential to dig interests and improve the service. 

### Computer Vision Internship at Augment Space

From the beginning of year 2018, I embarked on a journey that I have never been, the deep learning area. As an intern at Augment Space in Adelaide, I implemented the object detection algorithms on the property images. Moreover, I researched image matching algorithms and realized the motion analysis of images. During this internship, I self-learned deep learing from Coursera and got several certifications. 

## My Data Science Skills

- Data Wraggling and visualization in Python and R
- Database Management in SQL
- Communication skills

## Learning on the calendar
- I am taking 10601 Intro to Machine Learning this semester and hope to take advanced learning next semester.
- Review R programming and SQL queries
- Business sense

## Topics I am interested in

I believe a good data scientist should be good at communicating the findings. I am more interested in showcasing the results from data analysis and make instant impacts. 
### Social Network Analysis
    The world is full of networks. The form of network is not just limited to network on humans' connections like Facebook. Actually, network analysis on Facebook has yielded a lot of fun findings. Moreover, the interactions between people and jobs, people and local businesses are also of interest. Digging the mystery behind the network is a great charm to me.
	
### Analytics in Entertainment Industry
     I love music and movies. I like drama and celebrities. I know some production and entertainment companies have applied machine learning to serve customers better in different ways, such as predicting the taste of audience, recommend potential likeable movies and music to customers. I would love to learn more in this area.

## Beyond Data

- **Open to Multi-Culture**
   
  I was born in Shanghai, China. In high school, I participated in an exchange program and studied in Vancouver, Canada. In my junior year at college, I transferred to University of Missouri to continue my undegraduate study. In 2017, I was accepted into Global MISM at CMU. I studied in Adelaide, Australia for the first year. Now, I am in Pittsburgh.
  
  I am proud of my experience exposed to different cultures. Actually, I find people from different cultures can definitely share similar emotions and thoughts. It is warm when you two understand each other so well even though you spoke different languages and grew up with different cultures.
- **Love traveling**

  I love hiking, road trip, and traveling with friends and family. I can learn a lot from the Nature. To record each trip, I love taking photos and videos. In my casual time, I would spend some time making short films in memory of journeys. 

  The next destination I am eager to visit is Europe. Luckily, I have good friends studying in Europe!
  
- **Gym, Book**

  Well, I feel not good to tell about them right now. I read quite a few books in the summer holiday, but got busy after the school began.

- **Music**

  Music is in my blood. No matter Pop, classical, musicals, bring it on to me. One of my favourite singers might be Shawn Mendes and Imagine Dragons. 

## Belif

- To be unique is important. Fitting in is not cool!

- Hard work pays off maybe not now but in the future for sure.

- Listening to the heart is key to the happinese. And **my passion is in my heart**!
